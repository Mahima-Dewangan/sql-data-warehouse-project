Quality Checks
==================================================================
SCRIPT PURPOSE:
 - This script performs various quality checks for data consistency , accuracy ,
    and standardization across the 'silver' schema . It includes cheks for:
   - Null or duplicate primary keys.
   - Unwanted spaces in strings fields.
   - Data standardization and consistency.
   -Invalid data ranges and orders.
   -Data consistency between related fields.

Usage notes:
 - Run these checks after data loading silver layer.
 - Investigate and resolve any discrepancies found during the checks.

-----QUALITY CHECK FOR SILVER TABLE 
 JUST SCANNING THE FIRST TABLE COMPLETELY 
SELECT * FROM silver.crm_cust_info; 

(1)Check for Nulls or Duplicates in Primary Key
--Expectation: No Result

SELECT cst_id, COUNT(*)
FROM silver.crm_cust_info
GROUP BY cst_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >1 OR cst_id IS NULL;  -- WE have an NO issue , 

--- (2)Check for unwanted spaces
---- Expectation : No Results

----- (2.1)cst_firstname
SELECT cst_firstname
FROM silver.crm_cust_info
WHERE cst_firstname != TRIM(cst_firstname) --WE have an NO issue 



-----(2.2)cst_lastname
SELECT cst_lastname
FROM silver.crm_cust_info
WHERE cst_lastname != TRIM(cst_lastname) --- we have an NO  issue 

-----(2.3)gndr
SELECT cst_gndr
FROM silver.crm_cust_info
WHERE cst_gndr != TRIM(cst_gndr) --- we don't have any issue , we are not getting any spaces

-----(3)Data Standardization & Consistency 

-----(3.1) For gender
SELECT DISTINCT cst_gndr
FROM silver.crm_cust_info  --- we got NULL , F AND M 

-----(3.2) For marital_status
SELECT DISTINCT cst_marital_status
FROM silver.crm_cust_info; --- we got NULL S SND M


----JUST SCNANNING THE SECOND TABLE COMPLETELY
SELECT * FROM silver.crm_prd_info;

-------(1) Check for NULLS and Duplicates in Primary Key
----------Expectation : No Result
SELECT
prd_id,
COUNT(*)
FROM silver.crm_prd_info
GROUP BY prd_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1  OR prd_id IS NULL  --- we didn't get any null or duplicate

---(2) Check for unwanted spaces
---Expectation : No Results
SELECT prd_nm
FROM silver.crm_prd_info
WHERE prd_nm !=TRIM(prd_nm) --- everything is OK , no unwanted spaces

---(3) Check for NULLs or Negative Numbers
---Expectation : No Results
SELECT prd_cost
FROM silver.crm_prd_info
WHERE prd_cost < 0 OR prd_cost IS NULL  --- WE didn't get any NULLs

---(4)Data Standardization & Consistency 
SELECT DISTINCT prd_line
FROM silver.crm_prd_info ; --- we got Mountains,Roads,Other Sales AND Touring

----(5)Check for invallid Date Orders
--EXPECTATION : NULL
SELECT * FROM
silver.crm_prd_info
WHERE prd_end_dt < prd_start_dt  ----we correctected it 


-----JUST CHECKING THE THIRD TABLE CORRECTLY
SELECT * FROM silver.crm_sales_details; --everything is perfect--

---doing the quality check all together for the third table
SELECT DISTINCT 
sls_sales,
sls_quantity,
sls_price
FROM silver.crm_sales_details
WHERE sls_sales != sls_quantity * sls_price
OR sls_sales IS NULL OR sls_quantity IS NULL OR sls_price IS NULL
OR sls_sales <= 0 OR sls_quantity <= 0 OR sls_price <= 0
ORDER BY sls_sales , sls_quantity , sls_price;


--Doing the quality check for the fourth table

--Identify out-of-Range Dates
SELECT DISTINCT
bdate
FROM silver.erp_cust_az12
WHERE bdate < '1924-01-01' OR bdate > GETDATE()  --works fine

--Data Standardization & Consistency
SELECT DISTINCT 
gen
FROM Silver.erp_cust_az12  -- works fine


------Doing the quality check for the fifth table

---Checking the fifth table completely
SELECT *FROM silver.erp_loc_a101

--Data Standardization & Consistency
SELECT DISTINCT cntry
FROM silver.erp_loc_a101
ORDER BY cntry   --- works fine

-----Checking the sixth table completely
SELECT * FROM silver.erp_px_cat_g1v2
